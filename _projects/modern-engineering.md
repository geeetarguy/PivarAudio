## Overview

Zen Musical Harmonizer ZMH-1 is Pivar Audio's first app in iOS. It has four different ways to harmonizer: Playable, Shifter, Pseudo-Smart and Octave. 

It is primarily designed for guitar, but has many creative uses including a lot of fun with synthesizers, as well as interesting effects on vocals. Use it with Inter-App Audio and Audiobus.
