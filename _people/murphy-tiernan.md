Jonathan Pivar currently owns and runs Pivar Audio, as well as working as a Software Engineer for the SwitchCase Group in San Diego.

He started coding as a result of classes in Music Technology at UCSD with Miller Puckette and Tom Erbe. From there he went back to school for programming before working in computer science.

Zen Musical Harmonizer ZMH-1 was the result of years of experimentation in the recording studio and a fascination with audio programming. There are more apps in the works in his spare time. :-)
